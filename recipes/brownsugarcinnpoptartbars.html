            <h3><b>Desription</b></h3>
            <p>These homemade frosted poptart bars are me and my wife's absolute favorite sweet snack right now. She found the recipe on a facebook short or a tikkyTok or something like that and got together the stuff to make it and since then I believe she has put out about 5 or 6 batches and we munch on them all night. If you like the poptarts, or even if you don't but are a fan of sweets and cinnamon, you will love this recipe. It's not too difficult, but some care needs to be taken with the order you pour and mix the ingredients.</p>
